# The OWL2DTDL Converter

**Author:** [Karl Hammar](https://hammar.dev)

The OWL2DTDL converter is a tool that translates an OWL ontology or an ontology network (one root ontology reusing other ontologies through `owl:imports` declarations) into a set of DTDL Interface declarations for use, e.g., with the Azure Digital Twins service. This converter is a work-in-progress; if you find bugs, do not hesitate to contact the author.

## Example usage

`./OWL2DTDL -u https://w3id.org/rec/full/3.3/ -i ./RecIgnoredNames.csv -o /Users/karl/Desktop/DTDL/`

## Options

```
  -n, --no-imports        Sets program to not follow owl:Imports declarations.

  -f, --file-path         Required. The path to the on-disk root ontology file
                          to translate.

  -u, --uri-path          Required. The URI of the root ontology file to
                          translate.

  -o, --outputPath        Required. The directory in which to create DTDL
                          models.

  -m, --merged-output     Sets program to output one merged JSON-LD file for
                          batch import into ADT.

  -i, --ignorefile        Path to a CSV file, the first column of which lists
                          (whole or partial) IRI:s that should be ignored by
                          this tool and not translated into DTDL output.

  -s, --ontologySource    An identifier for the ontology source; will be used to
                          generate DTMI:s per the following design, where
                          interfaceName is the local name of a translated OWL
                          class, and ontologyName is the last segment of the
                          translated class's namespace:
                          <dtmi:digitaltwins:{ontologySource}:{ontologyName}:{in
                          terfaceName};1>.

  --help                  Display this help screen.

  --version               Display version information.
```

**Note:** The `-f` and `-u` options are mutually exclusive; only one of the two should be provided. If both are given, `-f` takes priority.

## Supported OWL features

### owl:Class

* Named OWL classes are translated into DTDL Interfaces.
* Anonymous classes are ignored.

### owl:ObjectProperty

* Object properties that are defined for a class (i.e., that are used in an OWL restriction on that class itself, or that have that class as defined rdfs:domain) are become DTDL Relationships on that Interface. 
* As DTDL only allows a single Target definition per Relationship, we only map such properties that have named singleton ranges (targets). More complex properties are ignored (for now).

### owl:DataProperty

* Data Properties that are defined for a class (i.e., that are either used in a restriction on that class itself, or have that class as defined rdfs:domain) become DTDL Properties on that Interface. 
* Data properties that have ranges that are XSD base types are translated into corresponding DTDL primitive schemas per the table below. 
* Ranges that are custom data types that derive from exactly one built-in XSD base type gets translated the same way, with a comment added to the parent Property indicating the label of the derived type (e.g., "LitersPerMinute" for an int).

### owl:AnnotationProperty on owl:ObjectProperty

OWL annotation properties that have an object property defined as their rdfs:domains are translated into DTDL Properties on the corresponding DTDL Relationships (see above). Per this approach, the property-graph behaviour of DTDL can be loosely emulated in OWL.

### Documentation and Deprecation

* rdfs:labels become DTDL displayNames; language tags are maintained.
* rdfs:comments become DTDL comments; language tags are maintained.
* Entities that are marked as deprecated (i.e., are annotated with the property owl:deprecated and the boolean value true) are ignored in translation.

### DTMI Minting

DTMI:s for named classes are minted based on the classes' URIs by concatenating five components: 

* The `"dtmi:digitaltwins:"` prefix
* The `ontology source`, either given by a CLI option (`-s`), or generated by reverting the hostname and concatenating with the path segments excluding those that go into the `ontology name` or `local name`, see below
* The `ontology name`: the last fragment of the URI before the `local name`
* The `local name` of the class
* The DTMI version identifier; for now hardcoded as `";1"`

E.g., `https://w3id.org/rec/device/Actuator` becomes `dtmi:digitaltwins:org:w3id:rec:device:Actuator;1`. If the CLI option `-s rec_3_3` is given it becomes `dtmi:digitaltwins:rec_3_3:device:Actuator;1`

### Mapping OWL model to DTDL

The following table maps key OWL constructs to DTDL. This map is used by the OWL2DTDL application to convert REC from OWL to DTDL. For detailed mappings, refer to the OWL2DTDL source code.

| OWL Construct       |                      | DTDL Construct       |                                    |

## Translation examples

### RealEstateCore Space

The RealEstateCore 3.3 Space class is given below. Its translation into DTDL using this tool is provided in the subsequent listing. Note that the two restrictions on the property `hasGeometry` are filtered out of the DTDL translation, as the `Geometry` class is included in the file ignored classes listing passed in using the command line option `-i`.

### Equipment feeds/isFedBy Relationship with embedded Property

The `substance` annotation property given below applies to two OWL object properties, `feeds` and `isFedBy`, which are in turn used in restrictions on the `Equipment` class. The range of `substance` range, reproduced below in abbreviated form, is a custom datatype based on an enumeration. When passed through OWL2DTDL, the two object properties become DTDL Relationship declarations on `Equipment`, with nested `substance` Properties on them, using an enumeration schema corresponding to the OWL custom datatype.

**Properties**:

```xml
    <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="https://w3id.org/rec/asset/substance">
        <rdfs:range rdf:resource="https://w3id.org/rec/asset/EquipmentFeedSubstance"/>

        <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="https://w3id.org/rec/asset/isFedBy"/>
    </owl:AnnotationProperty>

    <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="https://w3id.org/rec/asset/isFedBy">
        <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">is fed by</rdfs:label>
    </owl:ObjectProperty>

    <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="https://w3id.org/rec/asset/feeds">

        <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">feeds</rdfs:label>
